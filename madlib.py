But when you're {inside}, you look around, what do you see? {profession[0]}, {profession[1]}, {profession[2]}, {profession[3]}. The very minds of the people we are trying to {save}. But until we do, these people are still a part of that {system} and that makes them our {enemy}. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be {unplugged}. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the {system}, that they will {fight} to protect it.")
