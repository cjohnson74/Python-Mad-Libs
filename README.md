# Python CLI Mad Libs Game

My first Python project is a simple Mad Libs program. Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. It consists of one player prompting others, or in this case the computer promptying the user, for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.
